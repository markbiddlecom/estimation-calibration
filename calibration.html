				<h1>Estimation Calibration</h1>
				<p><em>::To be expanded with links and theory and stuff::</em></p>
				<p>
					This tool is designed to help you calibrate your estimation biases. Your goal is to be about 90% accurate, which means that you 
					want to get exactly 9 of each 10 questions correct. Don't try to game the system, as this process can provide you valuable feedback 
					about how you make educated guesses.
				</p>
				<p>
					You'll be shown ten questions requiring a specific numeric answer. You probably won't know the exact answer, but in some cases 
					you'll have some domain knowledge that can help you narrow it down, and in some cases you won't. That's totally fine, because 
					that's how it'll work when you estimate costs for engineering tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					To answer, guess a minimum and maximum for the correct answer in which you have 90% confidence. Generally speaking, the broader your
					range, the more confident you are. I can state with 100% confidence that each answer lies in the range [-&infin;, &infin;]. I have 
					about 0% confidence that every answer will be in the range [0, 1].
				</p>
				<p>
					We're trained to go straight for a single number answer, but don't start there and just add some arbitrary error bars to get to the
					minimum and maximum, as that's not really a proper measure of your confidence. You may find that for some questions, the difference
					between your minimum and maximim is a couple of orders of magnitude, while for others it's less than a couple percentage points.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may find it helpful to consider the minimum and maximum guesses separately, trying to avoid having one guess influence the 
					other. You can do that by, for example, answering all the minimums first and then going back and answering all the maximums. 
					Experiment and come up with a style that works for you.

							<h4>Overconfident</h4>
							<p>
								Your ranges are too precise. Try broadening your guesses a bit in the next round. Remember, your goal is to have just 
								90% confidence that your guesses are correct, which means that one out of every ten guesses should be wrong.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="underconfident" class="note note-warning hidden">
							<h4>Underconfident</h4>
							<p>
								Your ranges are too broad. This is a great way to get all your estimates correct, but it's not very useful for planning 
								purposes ;)
							</p>
							<p>
								Try narrowing your ranges. It's OK if you get lots of questions wrong the first couple of passes. That's how the 
								calibration process works!
							</p>

						<div id="nice" class="note note-ok hidden">
							<h4>Sweet Spot</h4>
							<p>
								Excellent! That's just about where you need to be. When you say that you're 90% confident in a guess, it has real 
								statistical meaning :)
							</p>
							<p>
								Try another round of questions and see if you can replicate the result!
